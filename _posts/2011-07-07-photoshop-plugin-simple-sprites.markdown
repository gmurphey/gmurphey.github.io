I've been working on a site recently that's needed a lot of [pseudo sprites](http://css-tricks.com/13224-pseudo-spriting), and I was getting frustrated with creating sprite maps by hand, so I created simple Photoshop plugin that takes a directory of images and merges them into a CSS friendly sprite map.

### Download the Plugin
I've added the plugin to GitHub, so [download now](https://github.com/{{site.social.github}}/{{page.github}}/zipball/master) and [fork away](http://github.com/{{site.social.github}}/{{page.github}})!
